# SBCoreDataLib
A Coredata Wrapper Framework which enables us to implement CoreData in a dynamic Manner.
This is wrapper of the [SBCoreData](https://github.com/sohamb1390/SBCoreData) Library.

This library provides all the necessary helpers to work with Core Data extensively. The primary focus of this library is to reduce all the overheads, all you have to do is pass on the server response JSON to the library through designated methods ***(Example project is available inside the project)*** and the libarary would do all the CRUD operations itself. The example project project provides two types of flavours of core data operation through local JSON files. One is Insertion and another one is updation. You can do rest of the operations by yourself, every methods written in the library has comments so that you won't get confused.
